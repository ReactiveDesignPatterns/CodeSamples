In most cases it is advisable to create an Issue before submitting a pull request, so that the proposed changes can be discussed. Trivial fixes (as for spelling or grammar) are an exception to this rule, and it can in certain cases be simpler to discuss within the code by opening a pull request. Please use good taste and common sense.
